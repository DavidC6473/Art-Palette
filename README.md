# Art-Palette

Art-Palette is a React application that utilizes the Unsplash API to generate a grid of random images. When an image is selected, a modal window pops up using React Modal to display the image. The application also extracts the color palette from the selected image using the ColorThief library and displays it in the modal. This allows users to find inspiration from new images and discover color palettes that match their inspiration.
